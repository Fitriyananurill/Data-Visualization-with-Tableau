# Airline Passenger Traffic Analysis (2005–2016) – Tableau Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](Dashboard%20Image.png)

1️⃣ Project Background

This project analyzes airline passenger traffic from 2005 to 2016 to evaluate long-term growth trends, regional distribution, operational activity, and airline performance. The objective is to transform historical aviation data into an interactive analytical dashboard using Tableau to support traffic monitoring and strategic planning.

2️⃣ Objectives

- Analyze total passenger growth over time
- Compare domestic vs international traffic
- Identify seasonality patterns
- Evaluate terminal usage distribution
- Determine top-performing airlines
- Understand regional passenger concentration

4️⃣ Dashboard Components & Design Logic

1. KPI Cards

- Total Passengers: 438.8M
- Total Airlines: 77
- Total Regions: 9
- YoY Passenger Growth: -77.2%
- Designed for high-level executive overview.

2. Passengers Trend (Line Chart)

- Tracks Domestic vs International growth.
- Shows consistent upward trend from 2005–2015.
- Significant drop observed in 2016.
- Purpose: Identify long-term growth trajectory and abnormal decline.

3. Seasonality (Heatmap)

- Displays monthly passenger volume by year.
- Highlights recurring peak months.
- Identifies demand fluctuation patterns.
- Purpose: Detect cyclical traffic behavior.

4. Activity Type (Stacked Bar)

- Compares Enplaned vs Deplaned passengers.
- Shows proportional growth over time.
- Purpose: Validate operational balance and traffic flow consistency.

5. Terminal Usage

- Identifies busiest terminals.
- Terminal 3 dominates passenger handling volume.
- Purpose: Evaluate infrastructure load distribution.

6. Passenger by Region (Pie Chart)

- US accounts for ~77% of total passengers.
- Other regions contribute significantly smaller shares.
- Purpose: Identify geographic traffic concentration.

7. Top 5 Airlines

- United Airlines (including pre-merger data) leads.
- Followed by United Airlines, SkyWest, American Airlines, Virgin America.
- Purpose: Evaluate airline market dominance.

5️⃣ Key Findings 

1. Passenger traffic increased steadily from ~13M (2005) to nearly 39M (2015) before a sharp drop in 2016.
2. Domestic traffic consistently accounts for the majority share (~3x international volume).
3. US region dominates passenger share (~77%), indicating high domestic concentration risk.
4. Terminal 3 handles the highest passenger volume (>150M cumulative).
5. Traffic distribution across airlines shows moderate concentration with United Airlines leading market share.
